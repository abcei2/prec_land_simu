# QUADCOPTER PRECISION LANDING SIMULATION

Let's test precision landing with gazebo+ardupilot+**python3.5**, yes python3.5 this is a convenient and faster way to do so  
because the goal is to load virtual gimbal c√°mera topic loaded in the example world **iris_runaway** of **ardupilot_gazebo**  
which deploya simulation of a drone who can be controlled by **QGroundControl**.

## Installation
### Ardupilot

### Gazebo

### ardupilot_gazebo
